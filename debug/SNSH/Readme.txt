Please do NOT use this for malicious activities, it was a
project I thought I'd make for fun. Just to see if I could
make such a program. Basically, it was a project to really
challenge me in socket (network) programming. This is NOT
to be used to for illegal activity, such as messing with
someone else's computer. You should just run this program
on your own terminal, if you are curious as to what it
does.
